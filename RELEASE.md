# Normal release flow

- All development is happening in the `sandbox-anton` environment. If new functionality is added we should write new automatic tests to cover it.
- After a feature is done and tested in the `sandbox-anton` environment, it is then deployed to the `tests` environment. Then, we check that automatic tests are passing using `dt test --notify` command.
- If automatic tests succeeded we deploy to the `sandbox` environment for manual testing by the team.
- Just before release to production we should check error logs from all our environemnts to make sure we didn't introduce any new bugs.
- If logs look good we deploy to the `stage` environment to check migrations if any and also perform the last round of manual testing. This is also a good opportunity to review all changes made once again. We should use old application versions for testing.
- If manual testing and migrations on the `stage` environment succeeded we prepare to deploy to the `production` but we must stick to the 9-12 GMT time window on weekends.

# Hotfix release flow

All the same as for normal flow except we don't have the required time window and should do a fix as soon as possible but without skipping any steps.

# Environments

### Sandbox Anton

- Anton is the owner and we should not have any other developers working here.
- Data may be corrupted since various debug and testing activities are regularly performed.
- Data may be restored from other enviroments like `production` for test purposes.

### Tests

- IEX data comes from the IEX Sandbox so it weakly correlate with real data.
- Data is erased during tests.
- We perform tests once daily starting from 0:00 GMT. The actual time may differ since the command is executed externally.
- We should not have 2 test commands running together or it will more likely fail.

### Sandbox

- We should not have any `testXXX` function deployed here so they should be removed during merge if needed.
- IEX data comes from the IEX Production so we should have the same data as in the `production` environment but in less volume.
- The team is working here so if something looks wrong it should be reported immediately and fixed.

### Stage

- Migrations are tested here just before we are ready to deploy to the production. Otherwise, this environment is rarely used.

### Production

- We have logs monitoring there once an hour so we should react immediately in case of misbehavior.
- All data adjust operations here should happen using `dt` command and only after double or even triple verification. There should be only one allowed person to perform such operations.
